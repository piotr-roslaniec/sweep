## 2025-09-13: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Sweep CLI will prioritize safety-first multi-language cleanup over aggressive automated cleaning, maintaining interactive confirmation for all deletion operations while expanding language ecosystem support.

### Context

Existing v1.0.3 codebase provides proven foundation with Rust, JavaScript, and Java support. User feedback indicates demand for Python support and large file detection. Technical debt from 5-6 years of outdated dependencies requires comprehensive modernization.

### Rationale

1. **Safety-First Approach**: Developer trust is paramount - accidental file deletion would be catastrophic for adoption
2. **Multi-Language Focus**: No competing tool provides unified cleanup across major ecosystems
3. **Incremental Modernization**: Gradual updates minimize risk while enabling new features
4. **Individual Developer Focus**: Maintain simplicity over enterprise complexity

## 2025-09-13: Technical Stack Modernization Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Upgrade to Rust 2021 Edition and modernize all dependencies in Phase 1, prioritizing stability and performance improvements over new features.

### Context

Current codebase uses Rust 2018 with dependencies 5-6 years out of date. Modern Rust offers significant performance and developer experience improvements. Risk of breaking changes requires careful migration strategy.

### Rationale

1. **Foundation First**: Stable modern foundation enables future feature development
2. **Performance Gains**: Async I/O and modern algorithms will significantly improve user experience
3. **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling and error handling reduce maintenance burden
4. **Future-Proofing**: Current foundation for next 3-5 years of development

## 2025-09-13: Distribution Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, DevOps Lead

### Decision

Maintain NPM wrapper as primary distribution method while improving native Rust installation options and adding automated release pipeline.

### Context

NPM wrapper provides cross-platform accessibility for JavaScript developers (largest user segment). Native Rust users prefer Cargo installation. Current manual release process creates deployment friction.

### Rationale

1. **User Accessibility**: NPM reaches broadest developer audience with minimal installation friction
2. **Ecosystem Integration**: Fits naturally into JavaScript-heavy development workflows
3. **Rust Community**: Native Cargo support serves Rust developers' preferences
4. **Automation Benefits**: Reduces release overhead and ensures consistency

## 2025-09-13: Feature Prioritization Framework

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Prioritize features based on: 1) User safety, 2) Language ecosystem coverage, 3) Performance improvements, 4) User experience enhancements, 5) Advanced features.

### Context

Limited development resources require clear prioritization. User feedback indicates strong demand for Python support and large file detection. Safety remains top concern for adoption.

### Rationale

1. **Safety First**: Any feature that improves safety gets highest priority
2. **Coverage Expansion**: Each new language multiplies potential user base
3. **Performance Threshold**: Tool must feel fast to maintain daily usage
4. **UX Polish**: Small improvements compound into significant user satisfaction gains
5. **Advanced Features**: Power user features drive engagement but shouldn't delay core functionality

## 2025-09-13: Configuration System Evolution

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, UX Designer

### Decision

Enhance existing .swpfile system with structured configuration while maintaining backward compatibility and simple syntax for basic use cases.

### Context

Current .swpfile system works but lacks advanced features users request (pattern matching, complex exclusions). Must balance power with simplicity for mainstream adoption.

### Rationale

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing user configurations must continue working
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple cases stay simple, complex cases become possible
3. **Familiar Patterns**: Follow conventions from gitignore, dockerignore, etc.
4. **Documentation Focus**: Clear examples more important than feature completeness
