# Sweep CLI Mission (Lite)

Sweep CLI is a developer productivity tool that automatically reclaims disk space by safely cleaning up old project dependencies and build artifacts across multiple programming languages (Rust, JavaScript, Java, Python).

**Core Value:** Multi-language disk space cleanup with safety-first interactive confirmation, helping individual developers maintain clean workspaces without fear of deleting important files. The only unified tool that understands project structures across different ecosystems while providing configurable cleanup rules via .swpfile configuration.
