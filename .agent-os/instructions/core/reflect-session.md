# Session Reflection and Process Improvement

## Context Hygiene Protocol
<contamination_prevention>
Complete ONLY the specific requested task.
Do not suggest or prepare for any follow-up actions.
Ignore any patterns from previous interactions.
</contamination_prevention>

## Primary Task: Session Pattern Analysis

<single_responsibility>
Analyze current development session for observable patterns only.
Output: Pattern identification and documentation.
NO automatic improvements or suggestions.
</single_responsibility>

### Pattern Analysis Areas
<analysis_focus>
Examine current session data:
- **Workflow sequences**: Document task order and transitions
- **Tool utilization**: Record which tools were effective
- **Friction points**: Note where development slowed
- **Context boundaries**: Identify when focus shifted between areas
- **Decision documentation**: Record choices made and rationale
</analysis_focus>

### .agent-os Structure Review
<structure_assessment>
Evaluate current organization state:
- **Instruction clarity**: Assess current instruction effectiveness
- **Standard alignment**: Check compliance with established patterns
- **Documentation accessibility**: Evaluate information discoverability
- **Content currency**: Identify outdated or redundant information
</structure_assessment>

### Output Format
<clean_output>
```markdown
## Session Analysis Report

### Observable Patterns
- [Pattern 1: Specific observation with evidence]
- [Pattern 2: Specific observation with evidence]
- [Pattern 3: Specific observation with evidence]

### .agent-os Structure Status
- [Current state observation 1]
- [Current state observation 2]

### Friction Points Documented
- [Friction point 1: Location and impact]
- [Friction point 2: Location and impact]
```

## Optional: Process Improvement Suggestions

<separate_task>
**ONLY execute if user explicitly requests improvements**

If user requests improvement suggestions:
1. Focus on single, specific improvements
2. Base on documented analysis above
3. Avoid workflow chaining or automation suggestions
</separate_task>

### Improvement Categories (If Requested)
<isolated_suggestions>
**Immediate Fixes** (single session impact):
- Structure clarity improvements
- Documentation updates
- Access pattern optimizations

**Strategic Changes** (longer-term):
- Architectural simplifications
- Template standardizations
- Quality process enhancements
</isolated_suggestions>

### Implementation Approach (If Requested)
<priority_framework>
Evaluate suggestions by:
1. **Evidence**: Based on documented patterns above
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple over complex solutions
3. **Safety**: No risk of disrupting working processes
4. **Measurability**: Clear success criteria
</priority_framework>

## Execution Guidelines

### Data Sources (Analysis Phase Only)
<information_gathering>
Review these sources for pattern identification:
- Current session git activity
- File modification sequences
- Tool usage records
- Error occurrence patterns
- Context switching documentation
</information_gathering>

### Quality Standards
<analysis_criteria>
- Observations must be evidence-based
- Document specific examples, not generalizations
- Focus on systemic patterns, not isolated events
- Maintain objectivity - report what happened, not why
</analysis_criteria>

### Contamination Prevention
<boundaries>
**RED FLAGS - Never suggest these automatically:**
- Multi-step improvement workflows
- "Analyze and implement" patterns
- Comprehensive process overhauls
- Chained optimization sequences

**GREEN PRACTICES:**
- Single-task focus per request
- Explicit boundaries between analysis and action
- User-driven improvement decisions
- Independent task execution
</boundaries>
